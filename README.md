# packdef2code
Source code generator (CPP backend provided) for packet classes. Useful for network class design as CIGI.

# WIP
It's a work in progress, you expect unfinished work, bugs and poor documentation.

# How it works
You define an input xml file (see <b>packetdef.xml</b>) specifiying classes with attributes and you'll get an output file in a target programming language (only c++ backend provided) with those classes (see <b>outtest.h</b>).<br/>
It's useful to generate packet classes library for CIGI or other packet based network protocols.
